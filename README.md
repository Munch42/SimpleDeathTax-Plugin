# SimpleDeathTax Plugin
 This is a fairly simple/lightweight plugin which I created for use on my personal server but thought that I would share since others might find it useful. It is fully configurable and it allows you to tax players upon death and to change how you tax them based upon their permissions and if they died to a player (if so, you can pay the player a portion or just the server instead) or to "natural" causes such as falling or being killed by a zombie. It is very similar to another DeathTax plugin on Spigot but that plugin only supports up to 1.14 while this one works on 1.18+ (Maybe a little earlier but this has not been tested) and it has completely original code. Hopefully you find the plugin useful!
